# Contributing to DATA

We welcome contributions that help build comprehensive, high-quality training data for AI coding agents. This guide provides detailed information on how to contribute effectively.

## 🎯 Our Mission

Creating the most comprehensive, well-documented collection of code examples and algorithms specifically designed for AI coding agent training, while maintaining the highest standards of code quality and educational value.

## 🌟 Contribution Standards

### Code Quality Requirements

- **📖 Documentation**: Every function, class, and complex algorithm must include comprehensive comments
- **🧪 Testing**: All new code requires appropriate test coverage
- **🎨 Style**: Follow language-specific style guides and conventions
- **⚡ Performance**: Consider algorithmic complexity and optimization
- **🔒 Security**: Implement security best practices, especially for sensitive operations
- **🌐 Compatibility**: Ensure cross-platform compatibility where applicable

### Review Criteria

All contributions are evaluated on:

1. **Functionality**: Does the code work correctly and handle edge cases?
2. **Readability**: Is the code self-documenting with clear variable names and structure?
3. **Testing**: Are there adequate test cases covering normal and edge cases?
4. **Documentation**: Are implementation details and usage clearly explained?
5. **Performance**: Is the implementation efficient for its intended use case?
6. **Educational Value**: Does this contribute to AI training data quality?
