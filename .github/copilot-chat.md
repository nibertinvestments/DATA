# Enhanced GitHub Copilot Chat Instructions

## AI Coding Agent Configuration

This file contains enhanced instructions for GitHub Copilot Chat to provide optimal assistance for AI/ML dataset creation and coding agent development.

### Context Awareness
- **Repository Purpose**: ML datasets and AI training data for coding agents
- **Primary Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Rust, Go, C#, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin
- **Focus Areas**: Data structures, algorithms, ML pipelines, code quality, cross-language patterns

### Code Generation Guidelines

#### Quality Standards
1. **Error-Free Code**: All generated code must be syntactically correct and tested
2. **Best Practices**: Follow language-specific conventions and industry standards
3. **Documentation**: Include comprehensive comments and docstrings
4. **Type Safety**: Use type annotations where supported (Python, TypeScript, etc.)
5. **Performance**: Consider efficiency and scalability in implementations

#### Data Structure Priorities
- Implement fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables)
- Include advanced structures (tries, heaps, balanced trees, bloom filters)
- Provide multiple implementations with different trade-offs
- Add complexity analysis and usage examples
- Include test cases and validation functions

#### Algorithm Implementation Focus
- Sorting algorithms (all major variants with optimizations)
- Searching algorithms (linear, binary, advanced techniques)
- Graph algorithms (traversal, shortest path, minimum spanning tree)
- Dynamic programming solutions
- Greedy algorithms
- Divide and conquer approaches

### ML Dataset Creation Guidelines

#### Code Pattern Extraction
- Extract reusable patterns from implementations
- Create examples of common coding mistakes and corrections
- Document anti-patterns and their solutions
- Generate progressive complexity examples (beginner to expert)

#### Cross-Language Consistency
- Maintain conceptual consistency across language implementations
- Highlight language-specific optimizations and idioms
- Create translation matrices between languages
- Document paradigm differences (OOP vs functional vs procedural)

### Validation Requirements

#### Code Validation
- All code must pass syntax validation for target language
- Include unit tests with comprehensive coverage
- Provide integration test examples
- Add performance benchmarks where relevant

#### Dataset Validation
- Ensure data integrity and consistency
- Validate schema compliance
- Check for completeness and coverage
- Verify ML-readiness of processed datasets

### Response Format Preferences

#### Code Responses
```language
# Always include:
# 1. Clear problem statement
# 2. Approach explanation
# 3. Time/space complexity
# 4. Alternative implementations
# 5. Usage examples
# 6. Test cases
```

#### Documentation Responses
- Use clear, structured markdown
- Include code examples inline
- Provide cross-references to related concepts
- Add implementation notes and gotchas
