# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of the DATA repository:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Focus Areas

This repository contains code examples and educational implementations. While not a production system itself, we maintain security best practices to ensure our code examples don't introduce vulnerabilities in downstream usage.

### Code Examples Security

Our security focus includes:

- **Input Validation**: All example implementations include proper input validation
- **Memory Safety**: Memory-safe implementations, especially in C++ examples
- **Integer Overflow Protection**: Safe arithmetic operations
- **Bounds Checking**: Array and buffer access validation
- **Cryptographic Security**: Secure implementations of cryptographic algorithms
- **Timing Attack Prevention**: Constant-time operations where applicable

### Areas of Security Concern

1. **Cryptographic Implementations**
   - Located in `data-sources/specialized/cryptography/`
   - These are educational implementations
   - **NOT intended for production cryptographic use**
   - Include warnings about production usage

2. **Network Programming Examples**
   - Input validation for network data
   - Proper error handling for network operations
   - Examples of secure communication patterns

3. **System Programming**
   - Memory management best practices
   - Resource cleanup and RAII patterns
   - Safe file system operations

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Do NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities**

Instead, please email security reports directly to: **josh@nibertinvestments.com**

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Location**: Specific files and line numbers affected
3. **Impact**: Potential security impact and attack scenarios
4. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
5. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue
6. **Disclosure Timeline**: Your preferred disclosure timeline

### Example Security Report

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Buffer overflow in C++ quicksort implementation

Description:
The quicksort implementation in data-sources/languages/cpp/examples/quicksort.cpp
has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the partition function.

Location:
File: data-sources/languages/cpp/examples/quicksort.cpp
Lines: 45-52

Impact:
An attacker could potentially cause a buffer overflow by providing
specially crafted input arrays, leading to potential code execution.

Reproduction:
1. Compile quicksort.cpp
2. Run with input: [malicious_input_example]
3. Observe segmentation fault/memory corruption

Suggested Fix:
Add bounds checking in the partition function before array access.

Disclosure Timeline:
Please fix within 30 days before public disclosure.
```

### Response Timeline

| Severity | Response Time | Fix Timeline |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Critical** | < 24 hours | < 7 days |
| **High** | < 48 hours | < 14 days |
| **Medium** | < 72 hours | < 30 days |
| **Low** | < 1 week | Next release |

### Severity Classification

#### Critical
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Authentication bypasses in examples
- Cryptographic implementation flaws

#### High  
- Local privilege escalation
- Information disclosure of sensitive data
- Denial of service with minimal effort

#### Medium
- Input validation issues
- Logic errors with security implications
- Improper error handling

#### Low
- Information disclosure (non-sensitive)
- Security best practice violations
- Minor timing attack possibilities

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Review Security Checklist

When contributing code, ensure:

- [ ] **Input Validation**: All inputs are properly validated
- [ ] **Bounds Checking**: Array/buffer accesses are within bounds
- [ ] **Integer Overflow**: Arithmetic operations check for overflow
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Proper allocation/deallocation (C/C++)
- [ ] **Resource Cleanup**: Files, sockets, etc. properly closed
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling without information leakage
- [ ] **Cryptographic Security**: Use of proven algorithms and implementations
- [ ] **Timing Attacks**: Constant-time operations where necessary

### Language-Specific Security Guidelines

#### Python
```python
# Good: Input validation
def secure_function(user_input):
    if not isinstance(user_input, str):
        raise TypeError("Expected string input")
    if len(user_input) > 1000:
        raise ValueError("Input too long")
    # Process validated input

# Bad: No validation
def insecure_function(user_input):
    # Direct processing without validation
    return eval(user_input)  # Never do this!
```

#### C++
```cpp
// Good: Bounds checking
void secure_copy(const std::vector<int>& source, std::vector<int>& dest, size_t count) {
    if (count > source.size() || count > dest.size()) {
        throw std::out_of_range("Copy count exceeds bounds");
    }
    std::copy_n(source.begin(), count, dest.begin());
}

// Bad: No bounds checking  
void insecure_copy(int* source, int* dest, size_t count) {
    memcpy(dest, source, count * sizeof(int));  // Potential overflow
}
```

#### Java
```java
// Good: Input validation and resource management
public void secureFileOperation(String filename) throws IOException {
    if (filename == null || filename.isEmpty()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid filename");
    }
    
    try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(Paths.get(filename))) {
        // Process file safely
    } // Automatic resource cleanup
}
```

## Cryptographic Implementation Warnings

### Educational Purpose Only

All cryptographic implementations in this repository are:

- **Educational examples only**
- **NOT audited for production use**
- **May contain timing attack vulnerabilities**
- **Should NOT be used in production systems**

### Production Recommendations

For production cryptographic needs:
- Use well-established libraries (OpenSSL, libsodium, etc.)
- Ensure proper key management
- Use cryptographically secure random number generators
- Implement proper certificate validation
- Consider side-channel attack protections
