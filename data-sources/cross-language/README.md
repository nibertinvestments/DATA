# Cross-Language Programming Patterns

This directory contains programming concepts, patterns, and examples that apply across multiple programming languages. These resources help AI coding agents understand universal programming principles.

## Directory Structure

### `design-patterns/`
Universal design patterns with implementations in multiple languages:
- **Creational Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype
- **Structural Patterns**: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Observer, Strategy, Command, Iterator, State

### `algorithms/`
Algorithm implementations across different languages:
- **Sorting**: Quick sort, merge sort, heap sort, bubble sort
- **Searching**: Binary search, linear search, hash-based search
- **Graph**: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, minimum spanning tree
- **Dynamic Programming**: Fibonacci, knapsack, longest common subsequence
- **String Processing**: Pattern matching, parsing, validation

### `data-structures/`
Fundamental data structures in multiple languages:
- **Linear**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues
- **Trees**: Binary trees, AVL trees, B-trees, tries
- **Graphs**: Adjacency lists, adjacency matrices
- **Hash Tables**: Hash maps, hash sets, bloom filters
- **Advanced**: Heaps, priority queues, disjoint sets

### `api-patterns/`
Common API design patterns and examples:
- **REST**: Resource design, HTTP methods, status codes
- **GraphQL**: Schema design, queries, mutations
- **RPC**: Remote procedure calls, service interfaces
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication patterns
- **Authentication**: OAuth, JWT, API keys

### `testing-patterns/`
Testing methodologies across languages:
- **Unit Testing**: Test structure, mocking, assertions
- **Integration Testing**: API testing, database testing
- **End-to-End Testing**: User workflow testing
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing, benchmarking
- **Property-Based Testing**: Generative testing, invariants

## Language Coverage

Each pattern includes implementations in:
- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Java
- C++
- C#
- Go
- Rust
- And other popular languages

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Consistency**: Patterns follow language-specific conventions while maintaining conceptual consistency
2. **Documentation**: Each implementation includes detailed comments explaining the pattern
3. **Testing**: All examples include test cases demonstrating usage
4. **Performance**: Notes on time/space complexity and performance considerations
5. **Best Practices**: Examples follow industry best practices for each language
