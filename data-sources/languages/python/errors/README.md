# Common Programming Errors and Solutions

This directory contains examples of frequent programming errors and their solutions across different programming languages. These examples help AI coding agents understand and avoid common pitfalls.

## Error Categories

### Language-Specific Errors
- **Syntax Errors**: Missing semicolons, incorrect indentation, bracket mismatches
- **Type Errors**: Type mismatches, null pointer exceptions, undefined variables
- **Runtime Errors**: Array index out of bounds, division by zero, stack overflow
- **Logic Errors**: Infinite loops, incorrect conditions, algorithm mistakes

### Cross-Language Error Patterns
- **Memory Management**: Memory leaks, dangling pointers, buffer overflows
- **Concurrency Issues**: Race conditions, deadlocks, thread safety
- **API Misuse**: Incorrect parameter types, missing error handling
- **Performance Problems**: Inefficient algorithms, resource leaks

## File Structure

Each error example includes:
- **Problem Description**: What the error is and why it occurs
- **Broken Code**: Example that demonstrates the error
- **Error Message**: Typical compiler/runtime error output
- **Solution**: Corrected code with explanation
- **Best Practices**: How to prevent similar errors

## Usage for AI Training

These examples are designed to:
1. Help AI agents recognize error patterns
2. Provide debugging strategies
3. Teach defensive programming practices
4. Demonstrate proper error handling
5. Show testing approaches to catch errors early
