# Data Sources for AI Coding Agents

This directory contains comprehensive datasets and resources designed specifically for training and assisting AI coding agents. The structure is organized to provide error-free, well-documented coding examples, patterns, and references that complement the main `code_samples/` directory which contains 1,409 production-ready implementations across 18 programming languages.

## Directory Structure

### Relationship with Main Repository
This directory complements the main [`code_samples/`](../code_samples/) directory:
- **`code_samples/`**: 1,409 production-ready implementations across 18 languages
- **`data-sources/`**: Specialized AI training data and educational resources (28 files)
- **`high_end_specialized/`**: Advanced algorithms and financial mathematics (7 files)

### Programming Languages  
Each programming language has its own directory containing various types of coding data:

- **`languages/`** - Language-specific data organized by programming language
  - Focus on AI training data structure and educational examples
  - Complements the production code in `code_samples/`
- **`cross-language/`** - Data that applies across multiple languages
  - Comparative implementations for pattern recognition
- **`specialized/`** - Domain-specific implementations
  - **`cryptography/`** - Modern cryptographic algorithms
  - **`ai_ml_algorithms/`** - ML algorithms from scratch
- **`frameworks/`** - Framework-specific examples and patterns (ready for expansion)
- **`tools/`** - Development tools, configurations, and utilities (ready for expansion)

### Current Implementation Status
- **Languages Directory**: Established structure with Python, Java, C++, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Specialized Content**: Cryptography and AI/ML algorithm foundations
- **Cross-Language**: Algorithm comparison framework
- **Frameworks & Tools**: Infrastructure ready for expansion

### Data Types
Within each language directory, you'll find:

- **`examples/`** - Clean, well-documented code examples
- **`patterns/`** - Design patterns and best practices
- **`templates/`** - Project templates and boilerplate code
- **`documentation/`** - Language references and API docs
- **`testing/`** - Test cases, unit tests, and testing patterns
- **`errors/`** - Common errors and their solutions
- **`libraries/`** - Popular library usage examples
- **`algorithms/`** - Algorithm implementations
- **`projects/`** - Complete project examples

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Quality Assurance**: All code examples are tested and error-free
2. **Documentation**: Each example includes comprehensive comments
3. **Best Practices**: Code follows language-specific conventions
4. **Modularity**: Examples are self-contained and reusable
5. **Versioning**: Clearly marked with language/framework versions

## Contributing

When adding new data:
1. Follow the established directory structure
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Ensure code is tested and error-free
4. Add appropriate README files for new categories
5. Use consistent naming conventions
