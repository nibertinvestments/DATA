# Data Sources for AI Coding Agents

This directory contains comprehensive datasets and resources designed specifically for training and assisting AI coding agents. The structure is organized to provide error-free, well-documented coding examples, patterns, and references across multiple programming languages.

## Directory Structure

### Programming Languages
Each programming language has its own directory containing various types of coding data:

- **`languages/`** - Language-specific data organized by programming language
- **`cross-language/`** - Data that applies across multiple languages
- **`frameworks/`** - Framework-specific examples and patterns
- **`tools/`** - Development tools, configurations, and utilities

### Data Types
Within each language directory, you'll find:

- **`examples/`** - Clean, well-documented code examples
- **`patterns/`** - Design patterns and best practices
- **`templates/`** - Project templates and boilerplate code
- **`documentation/`** - Language references and API docs
- **`testing/`** - Test cases, unit tests, and testing patterns
- **`errors/`** - Common errors and their solutions
- **`libraries/`** - Popular library usage examples
- **`algorithms/`** - Algorithm implementations
- **`projects/`** - Complete project examples

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Quality Assurance**: All code examples are tested and error-free
2. **Documentation**: Each example includes comprehensive comments
3. **Best Practices**: Code follows language-specific conventions
4. **Modularity**: Examples are self-contained and reusable
5. **Versioning**: Clearly marked with language/framework versions

## Contributing

When adding new data:
1. Follow the established directory structure
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Ensure code is tested and error-free
4. Add appropriate README files for new categories
5. Use consistent naming conventions
