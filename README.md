# DATA
Building Datasets, Structures and the like for ML and AI Coding Agents.

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive data sources designed specifically for training and assisting AI coding agents. The goal is to provide error-free, well-documented coding examples, patterns, and references across multiple programming languages and frameworks.

## Repository Structure

### üìÅ `data-sources/`
The main directory containing all coding data organized for AI agent consumption:

- **`languages/`** - Programming language-specific examples and patterns
- **`cross-language/`** - Universal programming concepts and patterns
- **`frameworks/`** - Framework-specific examples and best practices
- **`tools/`** - Development tools, configurations, and utilities

## Key Features

‚úÖ **Error-Free Code**: All examples are tested and production-ready  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed comments and explanations  
‚úÖ **Multi-Language Support**: Coverage of popular programming languages  
‚úÖ **Best Practices**: Industry-standard approaches and patterns  
‚úÖ **AI-Optimized**: Structured for easy consumption by AI coding agents  

## Supported Languages

Python ‚Ä¢ JavaScript ‚Ä¢ TypeScript ‚Ä¢ Java ‚Ä¢ C++ ‚Ä¢ C# ‚Ä¢ Go ‚Ä¢ Rust ‚Ä¢ PHP ‚Ä¢ Ruby ‚Ä¢ Swift ‚Ä¢ Kotlin ‚Ä¢ Scala ‚Ä¢ R ‚Ä¢ MATLAB ‚Ä¢ SQL ‚Ä¢ HTML/CSS ‚Ä¢ Shell/Bash

## Getting Started

Explore the [`data-sources/`](./data-sources/) directory to find the type of coding data you need. Each subdirectory contains a README with detailed information about its contents and organization.
